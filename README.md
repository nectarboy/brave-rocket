## How do I play ??
- Move your mouse to move your little rocket around
- If you hit a cloud or anything, you fucking die
- The higher your mouse is up, the faster you go, and the more points you get ;)
- Reach space or something ? idk
- Collect flying doggy coins and buy kickass skins with them

## How do I open this ??
If you downloaded it, simply double click `index.html` in the game's folder.
If something's broken or it doesn't work ... I'm sorry
