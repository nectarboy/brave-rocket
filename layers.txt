layers.txt


2 - falling coin --> explosion particles --> gui
1 - entities --> player (& player particles)
0 - bg --> floorprop ent, falling coin (fading), --> normal particles


my prefered order of buffering :3 (layers still applied)
bg -> entities -> particles -> player -> gui
this minimizes use of layers
